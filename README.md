## Overview

This is a case study research project that explores **game development using Artificial Intelligence**. The game, titled **Tao’s Adventure: The Mystery of the Dragon Seal**, was developed using **GameMaker Studio 2**.

The project focuses on creating a 2D prototype game aimed at improving **cognitive thinking, memory, and problem-solving skills**. It simulates an AI system that uses **predictive modeling** to detect in-game objects and adapt to player decisions.

## About the Game

The story begins in **Tao Village**, where the main character embarks on a mission to reach the **Lost Ghost Village** in search of a legendary dragon. The game features original artwork, a custom-designed logo, and characters created by me. The gameplay is inspired by **Zelda Adventures** and **Final Destination**, designed to give a nostalgic Nintendo-like experience.

## AI Integration

A **Decision Tree** model was used as the predictive algorithm, helping the in-game AI recognize patterns and objects. This added an intelligent layer to the gameplay experience. Development also included some **Python** integration to support the AI model and logic testing.

## Technologies Used

- **Game Engine:** GameMaker Studio 2  
- **Scripting Language:** GML (GameMaker Language)  
- **AI/ML Tools:** Python, Decision Tree (Predictive Modeling)  
- **Design Tools:** Procreate  
- **Focus Areas:** UX/UI Game Design, AI Simulation, Brain Function Testing

## Status

This project was created as a **final school project** and is a complete working prototype. It was also used for research purposes to demonstrate how games can positively impact brain development.
